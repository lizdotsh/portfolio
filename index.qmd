    <summary>Bayesian Econometrics (Spring)</summary>

    <b>Final Project</b>

    </tr> </table>

    This was made as a final project for my Bayesian econometrics class. All of the useful info is in the notebook.If any of the comments or anything are confusing, it's probably because of the target audience (my professor).

    <details> 
    <summary> TL;DR </summary>
    <ul>
    <li>It uses a full count census dataset, so I wouldn't try to run it. It took a long, long time to run on A100s. I did include a way (and the raw dataset) to run it using just a sample percentage of the dataset, though.</li>

    <li>A lot of the processing is done in duckdb, and I did not include the database in the repo. the full size of is gigantic, far too big for github. I included the cut down samples after processing, though.</li>

    <li>Jupyter could not load a large number of the figures without crashing, so they are all in the /figures directory. the chains of the models are also in .nc form in the /chains directory. I normally dislike jupyter because it is messy like this, but was a project requirement for me.</li>

    <li>There are a lot of comments in the notebook, but I did not include a lot of the code that was used to generate the figures. I did include the code for the figures that were generated in python, though.</li>

<summary>American Economic Mobility (Fall)</summary>
Papers and figures from my American Economic Mobility class.

<table class="bayes"> <tr> 
<td> [Github](https://github.com/lizdotsh/american-economic-mobility)</td>
</tr> </table>
<b> Final Project </b>: 

A paper on the regional demographic and mobility trends in Virginia. Very similar to the dataset used on the bayesian model above, this is the first paper I used it with. Basically analysis of linked census microdata from 17th century full count decennial censuses. This has been unchanged since it's creation and I made it rushing last minute before the deadline, so keep that in mind ahah.

<b> Dubois Project: </b>

An assignment to recreate our own visualizations based on W.E.B. Dubois' famous visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition. The code used to generate all this can be found [here](assets/american-economic-mobility/dubois/GOODWIN-source-code.html) and some notes about it can be found [here](assets/american-economic-mobility/dubois/GOODWIN-figure-notes.pdf).

### Migration Recreation

This recreates it almost exactly but using the full 1900 census instead.

### Demographics Recreation
This recreates a population pyramid he made, but this time using modern data.

### Original (Inspired)
A totally modern graphic I made in the same project.

<b> Custom Otree Game </b>

</tr> </table>

Created a custom otree UI to power an experiment run in my experimental economics class. Whole thing was hosted on heroku. 

(Note: this was not normal for the class. I just made my own thing since the software everyone else used was horrible.)

This was technically a group project I frankly I did almost all the work (and all of this part of it for sure). 

Also, there was a lot of weird trickery I did with symlinks when making it, so the github repo is a little weird. Basically `public_goods/__init.__.py` programmatically renders depending on the name of the directory it's in, which depends on the symlink. So I wrote the stuff once to create multiple games. There are definitely better ways to do this, but I was in a rush and it worked.

<details>
<summary>Note:</summary>
None of these projects were intended to involve actual programming and were supposed to be done in excel. I just intentionally replicated everything in a mix of R and Python so I could learn R/Python better. As this was much more of a first learning experience, this is from when I was very inexperienced and please take any bad code with grain of salt. I had only lightly used python before this class, and had never in my life used R before. Also did a lot of LaTeX graphics and equations, as most of the non-graph related assignments were intended to be done by hand (I wanted to show off).

<summary> Econometrics (Fall) </summary>

Easily my favorite class I have ever taken, made me fall in love with econ/stats. Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of all the files that well. They are also spread between stata, R, and python. Everything was assigned in stata, but I redid most of the assignments in R or Python to learn them better.

Anyways, here is what I have: 

<b> Assignment 2 </b>
Problem set on various datasets. All done in python (note: I was very bad at python back then).
<ul>
    <li>[Main Notebook](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%202/nhgis.ipynb)</li>
    <li>[Secondary Notebook](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%202/stuff.ipynb)</li>
    <li>[Instructions](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%202/Assignment2_instructions.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Github](https://github.com/lizdotsh/Econometrics-assignments/tree/main/Assignment%202) </li>
</ul>

<b> Assignment 3 </b>
Assignment on old faithful geyser data, intergenerational mobility, and robberies in chicago. All done in R and stata. 
<ul>
    <li>[Writeup, code, and figures (pdf)](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%203/assignment3.pdf) </li>
    <li>[Instructions](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%203/Assignment3_Instructions.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Github](https://github.com/lizdotsh/Econometrics-assignments/tree/main/Assignment%203) </li>

</ul>

<b> Assignment 4 </b> 
Assignment on predicting credit scores, the potential outcomes model, and a few other things. All done in R (and a bit of stata).
<ul>
    <li>[Writeup](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%204/Assignment%204.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Instructions](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%204/Assignment4_Instructions.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Code](https://github.com/lizdotsh/Econometrics-assignments/blob/main/Assignment%204/Assignment%204.Rmd)</li>
</ul>

<b> Assignment 5 </b>
Similar to previous. About castle doctrine natural experiments, class sizes and student performance, and research design. All done in R and Stata.
<ul>
    <li>[Writeup](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%205/Assignment5-econ308.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Instructions](assets/Econometrics-assignments/Assignment%205/Assignment5_instructions.pdf)</li>
    <li>[Github](https://github.com/lizdotsh/Econometrics-assignments/tree/main/Assignment%205) </li>
    <li>[Code](https://github.com/lizdotsh/Econometrics-assignments/blob/main/Assignment%205/Assignment5-econ308.Rmd)</li>
</ul>

<b>Final Exam</b>
I just did my final exam in R markdown and LaTeX instead of by hand as it was a remote thing. Everyone else did by hand for the most part. Don't have access to the exam itself anymore. I also got the highest grade in the class. 

<ul>
